<p>This is a simple, small JavaScript library to create exclusive slide-out
panels. It was written in March 2001 and includes support for Netscape 4 (!!).

<p>Though it works fine with modern browsers too, you should probably use
something more recent for new applications.

<p>Demos:
<ul>
<li><a href="css/">With CSS</a>
<li><a href="lots/">Animation performance (lots of menus)</a>
</ul>
